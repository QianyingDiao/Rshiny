Rshiny application
This project uses the dataset 'State Park Facility Points'. It is provided by The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) in 2018. These facilities contribute to the economic vitality and quality of life of local communities and directly support New York's tourism industry. We can visualize the distribution of different types of parks. For different regions in New York state, we can get information about the facility if it has golf available, camp available, playground available, nature center available and beach available, which is very helpful for tourists to make a diserable choice.
